Despite this, it was humanity's "sin" of disbelief and hate that led to the crucifition of Jesus, which in turn led to the pardoning of all human sin. In this instance, did humanity's sin prompt their own salvation? Is the speaker indicating that sin is so integrally human that God accounted for sin as the tool to provoking humanity's salvation through Jesus's murder?</note>		<l id="a019" corresp="n019">Crucifie thou what caus'd his Agony;</l> <note id="n019" target="a019" type="gloss">Speaker ends with a suggestion to the audience--a "moral" poem, as it were</note>
