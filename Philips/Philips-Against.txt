	<title>Against Pleasure</title>

	      <l>There's no such thing as pleasure here,</l>
	      <l>'Tis all a perfect cheat<note type="gloss">Philips is insinuating that pleasure isn't real. It is a false concept.</note>,</l>
	      <l>Which does but shine and disappear,</l>
	      <l>Whose charm is but deceit:</l>
              <l>The empty bribe of yielding souls<note type="gloss">And insinuation that those without godly souls find it easy to succumb to pleasure.</note> ,</l>
              <l>Which first betrays, and then controls<note type="gloss">Once someone has the taste of pleasure, they are fully gripped by it.</note>.</l>
	</stanza>

	<stanza>
              <l>'Tis true, it looks at distance fair,</l>
              <l>But if we do approach,</l>
              <l>The fruit of Sodom<note type="gloss">Sodom was a city destroyed by God for their sins.</note>will impair,</l>
              <l>And perish at a touch;</l>
              <l>It being than in fancy less,</l>
              <l>And we expect more than possess.</l>
	</stanza>

	<stanza>
              <l>For by our pleasure we are cloy'd<note type="gloss">Cloy'd refers to something being made weary by something that was initially pleasureable or sweet.</note></l>
              <l>And so desire is done;</l>
              <l>Or else, like rivers, they make wide</l>
              <l>The channels where they run;</l>
              <l>And either way true bliss destroys,</l>
              <l>Making us narrow, or our joys.</l>
	</stanza>

	<stanza>
              <l>We covet pleasure easily,</l>
              <l>But ne'er true bliss possess<note type="gloss">Bliss cannot be attained by something as blinding and detrimental as pleasure.</note>;</l>
              <l>For many things must make it be,</l>
              <l>But one may make it less.</l>
              <l>Nay, were our state as we would choose it,</l>
              <l>'Twould be consumed by fear to lose it<note type="gloss">We covet pleasure and happiness and thus are afraid of any other feeling or emotion.</note>.</l>
	</stanza>

	<stanza>
	      <l>What art thou, then, thou wingëd air,</l>
              <l>More weak and swift than fame?<note type="gloss">Pleasure is as fleeting as fame.</note></l>
              <l>Whose next successor is despair,<note type="gloss">If one has a taste of pleasure, their life will fall into despair.</note></l>
              <l>And its attendant shame.</l>
              <l>Th' experienced prince then reason had</l>
              <l>Who said of Pleasure,-"It is mad."<note type="gloss">The constant drive for fleeting pleasure will only bring madness to those who seek it out. Becuase it does not fulfill the soul, it only gives it a moment of a false sense of happiness.</note></l>
