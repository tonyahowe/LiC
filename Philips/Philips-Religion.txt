		<l>Religion, which true Policy befriends,</l>
		<l>Design’d by God to serve Man’s noblest ends,</l>
		<l>Is by that old Deceiver’s subtle Play</l>
		<l>Made the chief Party in its own decay,</l>
		<l>And meets that Eagle’s destiny, whose Breast</l>
		<l>Felt the same shaft which his own Feathers drest.<note type=“gloss”>An allusion to Aesop’s fable of The Eagle and The Arrow</note></l>
		<l>For that great Enemy of Souls perceiv’d,</l>
		<l>The notion of a Deity was weav’d</l>
		<l>So closely in Man’s Soul; to ruin that,</l>
		<l>He must at once the World depopulate.</l>
		<l>But as those Tyrants who their Wills pursue,</l>
		<l>If they expound old Laws, need make no new:</l>
		<l>So he advantage takes of Nature’s Light,</l>
		<l>And raises that to a bare useless height;</l>
		<l>Or while we seek for Truth, he in the Quest</l>
		<l>Mixes a Passion, or an Interest,</l>
		<l>To make us lose it; that, I know not how,</l>
		<l>’Tis not our Practice, but our Quarrel now.</l>
		<l>As in the Moon’s Eclipse some Pagans thought</l>
		<l>Their barb’rous Clamours her Deliv’rance wrought:</l>
		<l>So we suppose that Truth oppressed lies,</l>
		<l>And needs a Rescue by our Enmities.</l>
		<l>But ’tis Injustice, and the Mind’s Disease,</l>
		<l>To think of gaining Truth by losing Peace.</l>
		<l>Knowledge and Love, if true, do still unite;</l>
		<l>God’s Love and Knowledge are both Infinite.</l>
		<l>And though indeed Truth does delight to lye</l>
		<l>At some Remoteness from a common Eye; </l>
		<l>Yet ’tis not in a Thunder or a Noise,</l>
		<l>But in soft Whispers and the stiller Voice.</l>
		<l>Why should we then Knowledge so rudely treat,</l>
		<l>Making our Weapon what was meant our Meat?</l>
		<l>’Tis Ignorance that makes us quarrel so;</l>
		<l>The Soul that’s dark will be contracted too.</l>
		<l>Chimera’s<note type="gloss">A fabled fire-breathing monster of Greek mythology, with a lion's head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail (or according to others with the heads of a lion, a goat, and a serpent), killed by Bellerophon (Oxford English Dictionary).</note> make a Noise, swelling and vain,</l>
		<l>And soon resolve to their own Smoak again.</l>
		<l>But a true Light the Spirit doth dilate,</l>
		<l>And robs it of its proud and sullen State;</l>
		<l>Makes Love admir’d because ’tis understood</l>
		<l>And makes us Wise because it makes us Good.</l>
		<l>’Tis a right Prospect of things that we</l>
		<l>Owe our Uprightness and our Charity.</l>
		<l>For who resists a Beam when shining bright,</l>
		<l>Is not a Sinner of a common height.</l>
		<l>That State’s a Forfeiture, and Helps are spent,</l>
		<l>Not more a Sin, than ’tis a Punishment.</l>
		<l>The Soul which sees things in their native Frame,</l>
		<l>Without Opinion’s Mask or Custom’s Name,</l>
		<l>Cannot be clogg’d to Sense, or count that high</l>
		<l>Which hath its Estimation from a Lie.</l>
		<l>(Mean forbid Things, which by mistake we prize,</l>
		<l>And absent covet, but enjoy’d despise.)</l>
		<l>But scorning these hath robb’d them of their Art,</l>
		<l>Either to swell or to subdue the Heart;</l>
		<l>And learn’d that gen’rous Frame to be above</l>
		<l>The World in hopes, below it all in love:</l>
		<l>Touch’d with Divine and Inward Life doth run,</l>
		<l>Not resting ‘till it hath its Centre won;</l>
		<l>Moves steadily until it safe doth lye</l>
		<l>I’ th’ Root of all its Immortality;</l>
		<l>And resting here hath yet activity</l>
		<l>To grow more like unto the Deity;</l>
		<l>Good, Universal, Wise and Just as he,</l>
		<l>(The fame in kind, though diff’ring in degree)</l>
		<l>‘Till at the last ’tis swallow’d up, and grown</l>
		<l>With God and with the whole Creation one;</l>
		<l>It self, so small a part, i’ th’ whole is lost,</l>
		<l>And Generals have Particulars engross’d.</l>
		<l>That dark contracted Personality,</l>
		<l>Like Mists before the Sun, will from it flie.</l>
		<l>And then the Soul, one shining Sphere,  at length</l>
		<l>With true Love’s Wisdom fill’d and purged Strength,</l>
		<l>Beholds her highest Good with open Face,</l>
		<l>And like him all the World she can embrace.</l>
