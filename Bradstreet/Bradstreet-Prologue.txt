	<title>The Prologue</title>
	<author>Anne Bradstreet</author>
	
	<stanza>
		<l>To sing of Wars, of Captains, and of Kings,</l>
		<l>Of Cities founded, Common-wealths begun,</l>
		<l>For my mean<note type="gloss">Moderate, middling; average. -Oxford English Dictionary</note> pen are too superior things;</l>
		<l>Or how they all, or each their dates have run,</l>
		<l>Let Poets and Historians set these forth,</l>
		<l>My obscure lines shall not so dim their worth.</l>
	</stanza>
	
	<stanza>
		<l>But when my wond'ring eyes and envious heart</l>
		<l>Great Bartas<note type="gloss">French Protestant poet widely respected by the Puritans. -Britannica</note> sugar'd lines do but read o'er</l>
		<l>Fool I do grudge the Muses<note type="gloss">Ancient Greek goddesses of science and art.</note> did not part</l>
		<l>'Twixt him and me that over-fluent store.</l>
		<l>A Bartas can do what a Bartas will</l>
		<l>But simple I according to my skill.</l>
	</stanza>
	
	<stanza>
		<l>From School-boy's tongue no rhet'ric we expect,</l>	
		<l>Nor yet a sweet Consort<note type="gloss">concert</note> from broken strings,</l>
		<l>Nor perfect beauty where's a main defect:</l>
		<l>My foolish, broken, blemished Muse so sings</l>
		<l>And this to mend, alas, no Art is able,</l>
		<l>'Cause nature, made it so irreparable.</l>
	</stanza>
	
	<stanza>
		<l>Nor can I, like that fluent sweet tongu'd Greek<note type="gloss">An allusion to Demosthenes, an Athenian statesman recognized as the greatest of ancient Greek orators. He had a speech defect that he overcame on his own by speaking with pebbles in his mouth and by reciting verses when running or out of breath. - Britannica</note></l>
		<l>Who lisp'd at first, in future times speak plain.</l>
		<l>By Art he gladly found what he did seek</l>
		<l>A full requital of his striving pain.</l>
		<l>Art can do much, but this maxim's most sure</l>
		<l>A week or wounded brain admits no cure.</l>
	</stanza>
	
	<stanza>
		<l>I am obnoxious to each carping tongue</l>
		<l>Who says my hand a needle better fits.</l>
		<l>A Poet's pen all scorn I should thus wrong,</l>
		<l>For such despite they cast on Female wits:</l>
		<l>If what I do prove well, it won't advance,</l>
		<l>They'll say it's stol'n, or else it was by chance.</l>
	</stanza>
	
	<stanza>
		<l>But sure the Antique Greeks were far more mild</l>
		<l>Else of our Sex, why feigned they those Nine</l>
		<l>And poesy made, Calliope's<note type="gloss">Foremost of the nine Muses; she was later called the patron of epic poetry. -Britannica</note> own child?</l>
		<l>So 'mongst the rest they placed the Arts Divine,</l>
		<l>But this weak knot, they will full soon untie.</l>
		<l>The Greeks did nought, but play the fools and lie.</l>
	</stanza>
	
	<stanza>
		<l>Let Greeks be Greeks, and women what they are.</l>
		<l>Men have precedency and still excel,</l>
		<l>It is but vain unjustly to wage war;</l>
		<l>Men can do best, and women know it well</l>
		<l>Preeminence in all and each is yours;</l>
		<l>Yet grant some small acknowledgment of ours.</l>
	</stanza>
	
	<stanza>
		<l>And oh ye high flown quills that soar the Skies,</l>
		<l>And ever with your prey still catch your praise,</l>
		<l>If e're you design these lowly lines your eyes</l>
		<l>Give Thyme or Parsley<note type="gloss">Cooking herbs</note> wreath I ask no Bays<note type="gloss">Usually in pl. Leaves or sprigs of this tree, esp. as woven into a wreath or garland to reward a conqueror or poet; hence fig. the fame and repute attained by these. -Oxford English Dictionary</note>,</l>
		<l>This mean and unrefined ore of mine</l>
		<l>Will make your glist'ring gold, but more to shine.</l>
