		<l>Alas, slaine is the head of Israel,</l>
		<l>Illustrious Saul, whose beauty did excell </l>
		<l>Upon thy places, mountan'ous and high,</l>
		<l>How did the mighty fall and falling dye?</l>
		<l>In Gath<note type="gloss"> Gath and Ashkelon were two of the five major cities of the Philistines (Encyclopedia Britannica). </note>, let not this thing be spoken on, </l>
		<l>Nor published in the streets of Askelon,</l>
		<l>Lest Daughters of the Philistins <note type="gloss"> The Philistines were a non-Semitic people that resided in Canaan and posed a significant threat to the Israelites (Encyclopedia Brittanica).</note> rejoyce,</l>
		<l>Lest the uncircumcis'd lift up their voyce<note type="gloss"> David does not want word of the Israelites' defeat at Mount Gilboa to reach the Philistines, who will revel in the death of Judah's king. </note>:</l>
		<l>O! Gilbo Mounts<note type="gloss"> Mount Gilboa is a range of mountains located in the Jezreel Valley in modern-day northern Israel (Encyclopedia Britannica). </note>, let never pearled dew,</l>
		<l>Nor fruitfull showres your barren tops bestrew,</l>
		<l>Nor fields of offerings e're on you grow,</l>
		<l>Nor any pleasant thing e're may you show;</l>
		<l>For the mighty ones did soone decay,</l>
		<l>The Shield of Saul was vilely cast away;</l>
		<l>There had his dignity so sore a foyle<note type="gloss"> A repulse, defeat in an onset or enterprise; a baffling check (Oxford English Dictionary). </note>,</l>
		<l>As if his head ne're felt the sacred Oyle<note type="gloss"> "Then Samuel took the flask of oil, poured it on his [Saul's] head, kissed him and said, 'Has not the LORED anointed you ruler over his inheritance?'" (1 Sam. 10:1). </note>:</l>	
		<l>Sometimes from crimson, blood of gastly slaine,</l>
		<l>The bow of Jonathon<note type="gloss"> Jonathan was the son of Saul and a close friend of David, who made a loyalty pact with him in 1 Sam. 1:42 (King James Bible). </note> ne're turned in vaine,</l>
		<l>Nor from the fat, and spoyles, of mighty men,</l>
		<l>Did Saul with bloodlesse Sword turne back agen<note type="gloss"> Both Saul and Jonathan were mighty warriors; while they used different weapons, they both wielded them successfully in battle. </note>.</l>
		<l>Pleasant and lovely were they both in life,</l>
		<l>And in their deaths was found no parting strife<note type="gloss"> Despite Jonathan's loyalty to David and Saul's jealousy, Saul and Jonathan were united at the battle and united in death. </note>;</l>
		<l>Swifter than swiftest Eagles, so were they,</l>
		<l>Stronger than Lions, ramping for their prey.</l>
		<l>O Israels Dames, o're-flow your beauteous eyes,</l>
		<l>For valiant Saul, who on Mount Gilbo lyes;</l>
		<l>Who cloathed you in cloath of richest dye,</l>
		<l>And choyce delights, full of variety.</l>
		<l>On your array put ornaments of gold<note type="gloss"> David reflects on only the positive qualities of Saul, including the prosperity of Judah under his reign. </note>,</l>
		<l>Which made you yet more beauteous to behold.</l>
		<l>O! how in battell did the mighty fall,</l>
		<l>In mid'st of strength not succoured<note type="gloss"> To help, assist, or aid (Oxford English Dictionary). </note> at all:</l>	
		<l>O! lovely Jonathan, how wert thou slaine,</l>
		<l>In places high, full low thou dost remaine;</l>
		<l>Distrest I am, for thee, dear Jonathan,</l>
		<l>Thy love was wonderfull, passing a man;</l>
		<l>Exceeding all the Love that's Feminine<note type="gloss"> David compares the closeness of his friendship with Johnathan to the intimacy and loyalty experienced within marriage. Johnathan accepted David's destiny to become king, and remained loyal to him even after the reproach of his father. </note>,</l>
		<l>So pleasant hast thou been, dear brother mine:</l>
		<l>How are the mighty falne into decay,</l>
		<l>And war-like weapons perished away.</l>
