<l>When England did injoy her Halsion<note type= "gloss">Halcyon: Peaceful, prosperous</note> dayes,</l>
<l>Her noble Sidney wore the Crown of Bayes<note type= "gloss">Bay Laurel, a laurel wreath.</note>;</l>
<l>No lesse an Honour to our British Land,</l>
<l>Then she that sway'd the Scepter with her hand:</l>
<l>Mars and Minerva<note type= "gloss">Roman gods, Mars is the god of War, Minerva is the goddess of Wisdom, arts, and strategy.</note> did in one agree,</l>
<l>Of Armes, and Arts, thou should'st a patterne be.</l>
<l>Calliope<note type= "gloss">Muse of eloquence and epic poetry</note> with Terpsecher<note type= "gloss">Muse of dance and chorus</note> did sing,</l>
<l>Of Poesie<note type= "gloss">Poetry</note>, and of Musick thou wert King;</l>
<l>Thy Rhethorick it struck Polimnia<note type= "gloss">Muse of sacred poetry</note> dead,</l>
<l>Thine Eloquence made Mercury<note type= "gloss">Roman god of communication and eloquence</note> wax red;</l>
<l>Thy Logick from Euterpe<note type= "gloss">Muse of music</note> won the Crown,</l>
<l>More worth was thine, then Clio<note type= "gloss">Muse of history</note> could set down.</l>
<l>Thalia,<note type= "gloss">Muse of Comedy and idyllic poetry</note> and Melpomene,<note type= "gloss">Muse of Tragedy</note> say th' truth,</l>
<l>(Witness Arcadia,<note type= "gloss">Long prose work written by Sir Philip Sidney</note> penn'd in his youth)</l>
<l>Are not his Tragick Comedies so acted.</l>
<l>As if your nine-fold wit had been compacted;</l>
<l>To shew the world, they never saw before,</l>
<l>That this one volumne should exhaust your store.</l>
<l>I prase thee not for this, it is unfit,</l>
<l>This was thy shame, O miracle of wit;</l>
<l>Yet doth thy shune<note type= "gloss">?</note> (with all) purchase renown,</l>
<l>What doe thy vertues then? Oh, honours crown!</l>
<l>In all records, thy Name I ever see,</l>
<l>Put with an Epithet of dignity;</l>
<l>Which shewes,<note type= "gloss">Shows</note> thy worth was great, thine honour such,</l>
<l>The love thy country ought thee, was as much.</l>
<l>Let then, none dis-allow of these my straines,</l>
<l>Which have the self-same blood yet in my veines;</l>
<l>Who honours thee for what was honourable,</l>
<l>But leaves the rest, as most unprofitable :</l>
<l>Thy wiser dayes, condemn'd thy witty works,</l>
<l>Who knowes the Spels that in thy Rethorick lurks?</l>
<l>But some infatuate fooles soone caught therein,</l>
<l>Found Cupids Dam,<note type= "gloss">Referring to Psyche</note> had never such a Gin<note type= "gloss">Skill, ingenuity</note>;</l>
<l>Which makes feverer eyes but scorn thy Story,</l>
<l>And model Maids, and Wives, blush at thy glory;</l>
<l>Yet, he's a beetle head,<note type= "gloss">Proverbial phrase for idiot</note> that cann't discry<note type= "gloss">Catch sight of</note></l>
<l>A world of treasure, in that rubbish lye;</l>
<l>And doth the selfe, thy worke, and honour wrong,</l>
<l>(O brave Refiner of the British tongue;)</l>
<l>That sees not learning, valour, and morality,</l>
<l>Justice, friendship, and kind hospitality;</l>
<l>Yea, and Divinity within thy Book,</l>
<l>Such were prejudicate,<note type= "gloss">Judged beforehand</note> and did not look:</l>
<l>But to say truth, thy worth I shale<note type= "gloss">Shall</note> but staine,</l>
<l>Thy fame, and praise, is farre beyond my straine</l>
<l>Yet great Augustus was content (we know)</l>
<l>To be saluted by a silly Crow;</l>
<l>Then let such Crowes as I, thy praises sing,</l>
<l>A Crow's a Crow, and Caesar is a King.</l>
<l>O brave Achilles,<note type= "gloss">One of the great Greek mythological heroes, associated with the Iliad</note> I with some Homer<note type= "gloss">Ancient blind Greek epic poet, composed the Iliad and Odyssey</note> would</l>
<l>Engrave on Marble, in characters of Gold,</l>
<l>What famous feats thou didst, on Flanders<note type= "gloss">Northern Belgium</note> coast,</l>
<l>Of which, this day, faire Belgia doth boast.</l>
<l>Of Zutphon, Zutphon,<note type= "gloss">Site of the battle</note> that most fatall City,</l>
<l>Made famous by thy fall, much more's the pitty,</l>
<l>Ah, in his blooming prime, death pluckt this Rose,</l>
<l>E're he was ripe; his thred cut Atropos.<note type= "gloss">One of the three Fates; she cuts the thread of a person's life.</note></l>
<l>Thus Man is borne to dye, and dead is he,</l>
<l>Brave Hector<note type= "gloss">Brave Trojan hero, killed by Achilles</note> by the walls of Troy,<note type= "gloss">The siege of Troy was the subject of Homer's Iliad</note> we see:</l>
<l>Oh, who was neare thee, but did sore repine;</l>
<l>He rescued not with life, that life of thine,</l>
<l>But yet impartiall Death this Boone did give,</l>
<l>Though Sidney dy'd, his valiant name should live;</l>
<l>And live it doth, in spight of death, through fame,</l>
<l>Thus being over-come, he over-came.</l>
<l>Where is that envious tongue, but can afford, </l>
<l>Of this our noble Scipio<note type= "gloss">The Roman general who defeated Hannibal's invasion of Rome</note> some good word?</l>
<l>Noble Bartas,<note type= "gloss">French Huguenot poet who served in Henry IV of France's court</note> this to thy praise adds more,</l>
<l>In sad, sweet verse, thou didst his death deplore;</l>
<l>Illustrious Stella,<note type= "gloss">Astrophel and Stella was a sonnet sequence written by Sir Philip Sidney; Astrophell refers to this in the next line</note> thou didst thine full well,</l>
<l>If thine aspect was milde to Astrophell;</l>
<l>I feare thou wert a Commet, did portend</l>
<l>Such prince as he, his race should shortly end;</l>
<l>If such Stars as these, sad presages be,</l>
<l>I with no more such Blazers we may see;</l>
<l>But thou art gone, such Meteors never last,</l>
<l>And as thy beauty, so thy name would waft,</l>
<l>But that is record by Philips hand,</l>
<l>That such an omen once was in out land;</l>
<l>O princely Philip, rather Alexander,<note type= "gloss">Alexander the Great, Greek conqueror of large swath of Mediterranean</l>
<l>Who wert of honours band, the chief Commander.</l>
<l>How could that Stella, so confine thy will?</l>
<l>To wait till she, her influence distill,</l>
<l>I rather judg'd thee of his mind that wept,</l>
<l>To be within the bounds of one world kept,</l>
<l>But Omphala,<note type= "gloss">Mistress to whom Hercules was enslaved, forced him to do traditionally women's work, among other things.</note> set Hercules to spin,</l>
<l>And Mars himself was ta'n by Venus<note type= "gloss">Roman goddess of love, wife of Vulcan and mistress of Mars</note> gin;</l>
<l>Then wonder lesse, if warlike Philip yield,</l>
<l>When such a Hero shoots him out o'th' field,</l>
<l>Yet this preheminence<note type= "gloss">Preeminence, superiority</note> thou hast above,</l>
<l>That thine was true, but theirs adult'rate<note type= "gloss">Make something worse by mixing in inferior substance.</note> love.</l>
<l>Fain would I shew, how thou fame's path didst tread,</l>
<l>But now into such Lab'rinths am I led</l>
<l>With endlesse turnes, the way I find not out,</l>
<l>For to persist, my muse is more in doubt:</l>
<l>Calls me ambitious tool, that durst aspire,</l>
<l>Enough for me to look, and so admire.</l>
<l>And makes me now with Sylvester confesse,</l>
<l>But Sydney's Muse, can sing his worthinesse.</l>
<l>Too late my errour see, that durst presume</l>
<l>To fix my faltring lines upon his tomb:</l>
<l>Which are in wort, as far short of his due,</l>
<l>As Vulcan<note type= "gloss">Roman god of smithing, husband of Venus.</note> is, of Venus native hue.</l>
<l>Goodwill, did make my head-long pen to run,</l>
<l>Like unwise Phaeton<note type= "gloss">Son of Apollo who tried to drive his father's chariot across the sky; he lost control and set the world ablaze, forcing Zeus to kill him with a thunderbolt</note> his ill guided sonne,</l>
<l>Till taught to's cost, for his too hasty hand,</l>
<l>He left that charge by Phoebus<note type= "gloss">God of the Sun</note> to be man'd:</l>
<l>So proudly foolish I, with Phaeton strive,</l>
<l>Fame's flaming Chariot for to drive.</l>
<l>Til terrour-struck for my too weighty charge.</l>
<l>I leave't in brief, Apollo do't at large.</l>
<l>Apollo laught to patch up what's begun,</l>
<l>He bad drive, and he would hold the Sun,</l>
<l>Better my hap, then was his darlings fate,</l>
<l>For dear regard he had of Sydney's state,</l>
<l>Who in his Deity, had so deep share,</l>
<l>That those that name his fame, he needs must spare,</l>
<l>He promis'd much, but th' muses had no will,</l>
<l>To give to their detractor any quill.</l>
<l>With high disdain, they said they gave no more,</l>
<l>Since Sydney had exhausted all their store,</l>
<l>That this contempt it did the more perplex,</l>
<l>In being done by one of their own sex;</l>
<l>They took from me, the scribling pen I had,</l>
<l>I to be eas'd of such a task was glad.</l>
<l>For to revenge his wrong, themselves ingage,</l>
<l>And drave me from Parnassus<note type= "gloss">The site of the Dionysian mysteries, some of which included women who drove themselves into a frenzied state.</note> in a rage,</l>
<l>Not because, sweet Sydney's fame was not dear,</l>
<l>But I had blemish'd theirs, to make't appear:</l>
<l>I pensive for my fault, sat down, and then,</l>
<l>Errata, through their leave thre me my pen,</l>
<l>For to conclude my poem two lines they daigne,</l>
<l>Which writ, she bad return't to them again.</l>
<l>So Sydney's fame, I leave to England's Rolls,<note type= "gloss">Official records of parliamentary meetings and acts.</note></l>
<l>His bones do lie interr'd in stately Pauls.<note type= "gloss">Sir Philip Sidney was buried St. Paul's Cathedral in London.</note></l>
