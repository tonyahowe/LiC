            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following POEMS were written originally for the Amusement of the Author, as they
               were the Products of her leisure Moments. She had no Intention ever to have published
               them; nor would they now have made their Appearance, but at the Importunity of many
               of her best, and most generous Friends; to whom she considers herself, as under the
               greatest Obligations.</p>
            <p>As her Attempts in Poetry are now sent into the World, it is hoped the Critic will
               not severely censure their Defects; and we presume they have too much Merit<pb n="v"
                  id="v.png"/>to be cast aside with Contempt, and worthless and trifling
               Effusions.</p>
            <p>As to the Disadvantages she has laboured under, with Regard to Learning, nothing
               needs to be offered, as her Master's Letter in the following Page will sufficiently
               shew the Difficulties in the Respect she had to encounter.</p>
            <p>With all their Imperfections, the Poems are now humbly submitted to the Perusal of
               the Public.</p>

            <head>The following is a Copy of a LETTER sent by the<lb/>Author's Master to the
               Publisher</head>
            <p>PHILLIS was brought from <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                  >America</hi>, in the Year 1761, between Seven and Eight Years of Age. Without any
               Assistance from School Education, and by only what she was taught in the Family, she,
               in sixteen Months Time from her Arrival, attained the English Language, to which she
               was an utter Stranger before, the such a Degree, as to read any, the most difficult
               Parts of the Sacred Writings, to the great Astonishment of all who heard her.</p>
            <p>As to her WRITING, her own Curiosity led her to it; and this she learnt in so short a
               Time, that in the Year 1765, she wrote a Letter to the Rev. Mr. OCCOM, the <hi
                  rend="italic">Indian</hi> Minister, while in <hi rend="italic">England</hi>.</p>
            <p>She has a great Inclination to learn the Latin Tongue, and has made some Progress in
               it. This Relation is given by her Master who bought her, and with whom she now
               lives.</p>

            <head>To the PUBLICK.</head>
            <p>AS it has been repeatedly suggested to the Publisher, by Persons, who have seen the
               Manuscript, that Numbers would be ready to suspect they were not really the Writings
               of PHILLIS, he has procured the following Attestation, from the most respectable
               Characters in <hi rend="italic">Boston</hi>, that none might have the least Ground
               for disputing their <hi rend="italic">Original</hi>. </p>
            <p>WE whose Names are under-written, do assure the World, that the POEMS specified in
               the following Page, <note n="*" id="pvii.n1">The Words <hi rend="italic">"following
                     Page,"</hi> allude to the Contents of the Manuscript Copy, which are wrote at
                  the Back of the above Attestation.</note> were (as we verily believe) written by
               PHILLIS, a young Negro Girl, who was but a few Years since, brought an uncultivated
               Barbarian from <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi>, and has ever since been, and now is,
               under the Disadvantage of serving as a Slave in a Family in this Town. She has been
               examined by some of the best Judges, and is thought qualified to write them. <list>

                     "intrinsic" (1) or God-given, and therefore appropriate. The word "ardor" also
                     connotes physical desire and flame-like passion, according to the OED (n.3).

                     “presid[e] over the different kinds of poetry, and over the arts and sciences."
                     The “invocation of the muse” to aid the poet's work is often used by
                     neoclassical authors like those whom Wheatley has clearly read and was
                     influenced by, including <ref target="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/685428">Milton</ref> and <ref target="https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCBgqF1yFXYC">Pope</ref>. However, Hilene Flanzbaum suggests
                     that Wheatley’s notably frequent invocation of the muse is more significant
                     than formulaic or imitative--it is “the very means by which she usurps power
                     for herself and claims a berth for her own thoughts, emotions and desires. And
                     while some may claim that these functions accompany any appearance of the muse,
                     when the muses bestow their power on a black female slave, they transport
                     Wheatley to a domain surprisingly free of restriction and previously forbidden”

                     Orientalist notions about Egypt and Egyptian religiosity, which was believed to
                     be full of occult practices. Early nineteenth-century British historian and

                     (in)famous poems, "On being brought from AFRICA to AMERICA" alludes to the
                     experiences of many Africans who became subject to the <ref

                        >transatlantic slave trade</ref>. Wheatley uses biblical references and
                     direct address to appeal to a Christian audience, while also defending the
                     ability of her "sable race" to become "refin'd" through Christian theology.
                     Henry Louis Gates, who in <ref target="https://books.google.com/books?id=vzXnCwAAQBAJ"><hi rend="italic">Figures in Black:
                           Words, Signs, and the "Racial" Self</hi></ref> (1989) situates Wheatley
                     as an important voice in the eighteenth-century debate about natural human
                     rights, summarizes the "recurrent suggestion that Wheatley has remained aloof
                     from matters that were in any sense racial, or more correctly, 'positively'
                     racial," as a "misreading" (74-75). Notable for the complexity of its brief
                     discussion of blackness in the Christian slaveholding American republic, this
                     poem in particular is frequently criticized for its apparent rejection of
                     Africa and African-ness. However, Wheatley was working within a non-free
                     context, and her critique of slavery is mediated by Christianity acquired as
                     part of her enslavement. For a fuller exploration of Wheatley’s poem, see <ref

                  educational journey, Wheatley advises students at the University of Cambridge
                  in New England to appreciate and "[i]mprove" (21) the privilege of their
                  education by "shunn[ing]" (25) the "transient sweetness" (29) of sin using a
                  variety of religious images. The University of Cambridge in New England is now

                        Katherine Clay Bassard</a>, Wheatley wrote this poem when she was about
                  fourteen years old (41). For more information on women's writing in the early

               <span id="ardor" type="editorial" resp="JW"><p>Wheatley works from the premise,
                  commonly used among early women writers and the enslaved who were restricted
                  from intellectual pursuits like writing, that her desire to write is
                  "intrinsic" (1) or God-given, and therefore appropriate. The word "ardor" also
                  connotes physical desire and flame-like passion, according to the OED (n.3).

                  ><hi rend="italic">A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and
                     Mythology</hi></a>, the Muses are “inspiring goddesses of song" who
                  “presid[e] over the different kinds of poetry, and over the arts and sciences."
                  The “invocation of the muse” to aid the poet's work is often used by
                  neoclassical authors like those whom Wheatley has clearly read and was
                  influenced by, including <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/685428">Milton</a> and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCBgqF1yFXYC">Pope</a>. However, Hilene Flanzbaum suggests
                  that Wheatley’s notably frequent invocation of the muse is more significant
                  than formulaic or imitative--it is “the very means by which she usurps power
                  for herself and claims a berth for her own thoughts, emotions and desires. And
                  while some may claim that these functions accompany any appearance of the muse,
                  when the muses bestow their power on a black female slave, they transport
                  Wheatley to a domain surprisingly free of restriction and previously forbidden”

                  visited upon Egypt. This reference is also in line with contemporary
                  Orientalist notions about Egypt and Egyptian religiosity, which was believed to
                  be full of occult practices. Early nineteenth-century British historian and
                  scholar Thomas Maurice explores these ideas of idolatry and superstition in

                  (6). Henry Louis Gates argues that Wheatley's very presence as an author

                  experiences of many Africans who became subject to the <a

                     >transatlantic slave trade</a>. Wheatley uses biblical references and
                  direct address to appeal to a Christian audience, while also defending the
                  ability of her "sable race" to become "refin'd" through Christian theology.
                  Henry Louis Gates, who in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vzXnCwAAQBAJ"><hi rend="italic">Figures in Black:
                     Words, Signs, and the "Racial" Self</hi></a> (1989) situates Wheatley
                  as an important voice in the eighteenth-century debate about natural human
                  rights, summarizes the "recurrent suggestion that Wheatley has remained aloof
                  from matters that were in any sense racial, or more correctly, 'positively'
                  racial," as a "misreading" (74-75). Notable for the complexity of its brief
                  discussion of blackness in the Christian slaveholding American republic, this
                  poem in particular is frequently criticized for its apparent rejection of
                  Africa and African-ness. However, Wheatley was working within a non-free
                  context, and her critique of slavery is mediated by Christianity acquired as
                  part of her enslavement. For a fuller exploration of Wheatley’s poem, see <a
