This, my Lord, is for want of thinking Rightly; if Men wou'd consider with Reason, they wou'd have another sort of Opinion, and Esteem of Dedications; and wou'd believe almost every Great Man has enough to make him Worthy of all that can be said of him there. My Lord, a Picture-drawer, when he intends to make a good Picture, essays the Face many Ways, and in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e199">[Page]</span>many Lights, before he begins; that he may chuse, from the several turns of it, which is most Agreeable, and gives it the best Grace; and if there be a Scar, an ungrateful Mole, or any little Defect, they leave it out; and yet make the Picture extreamly like: But he who has the good Fortune to draw a Face that is exactly Charming in all its Parts and Features, what Colours or Agreements can be added to make it Finer? All that he can give is but its due; and Glories in a Piece whose Original alone gives it its Perfection. An ill Hand may diminish, but a good Hand cannot augment its Beauty. A Poet is a Painter <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e201">[Page]</span>in his way; he draws to the Life, but in another kind; we draw the Nobler part, the Soul and Mind; the Pictures of the Pen shall out-last those of the Pencil, and even Worlds themselves. 'Tis a short Chronicle of those Lives that possibly wou'd be forgotten by other Historians, or lye neglected there, however deserving an immortal Fame; for Men of eminent Parts are as Exemplary as even Monarchs themselves; and Virtue is a noble Lesson to be learn'd, and 'tis by Comparison we can Judge and Chuse. 'Tis by such illustrious <a class="link_ref" id="a002" href="#n002" title="Precedents">Presidents</a> , as your Lordship, the World can be Better'd and Refin'd; when a great part of the lazy Nobi<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e206">[Page]</span>lity shall, with Shame, behold the admirable Accomplishments of a Man so Great, and so Young.</p><p>Your Lordship has Read innumerable Volumes of Men, and Books; not Vainly for the gust of Novelty, but Knowledge, excellent Knowledge: Like the industrious Bee, from every Flower you return Laden with the precious Dew, which you are sure to turn to the Publick Good. You hoard no one Perfection, but lay it all out in the Glorious Service of your Religion and Country; to both which you are a useful and necessary Honour: They both want such Supporters; and 'tis only Men of so elevated Parts,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e210">[Page]</span> and fine Knowledge; such noble Principles of Loyalty and Religion this Nation Sighs for. Where shall we find a Man so Young, like St. <span class="hi">Augustine,</span> in the midst of all his Youth and Gaiety, Teaching the World divine Precepts, true Notions of Faith, and Excellent Morality, and, at the same time, be also a perfect Pattern of all that accomplish a Great Man? You have, my Lord, all that refin'd Wit that Charms, and the Affability that Obliges; a Generosity that gives a Lustre to your Nobility; that Hospitality, and Greatness of Mind, that ingages the World; and that admirable Conduct, that so <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e215">[Page]</span>well Instructs it. Our Nation ought to regret and bemoan their Misfortunes, for not being able to claim the Honour of the Birth of a Man who is so fit to serve his Majesty, and his Kingdoms, in all Great and Publick Affairs: And to the Glory of your Nation be it spoken, it produces more considerable Men, for all fine Sence, Wit, Wisdom, Breeding, and Generosity (for the generality of the Nobility) than all other Nations can Boast; and the Fruitfulness of your Virtues sufficiently make amends for the Barrenness of your Soil: Which however cannot be incommode to your Lordship; since your Quality, and the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e217">[Page]</span>Veneration that the Commonalty naturally pay their Lords, creates a flowing Plenty there—that makes you Happy. And to compleat your Happiness, my Lord, Heaven has blest you with a Lady, to whom it has given all the Graces, Beauties, and Virtues of her Sex; all the Youth, Sweetness of Nature; of a most illustrious Family; and who is a most rare Example to all Wives of Quality, for her eminent Piety, Easiness, and Condescention; and as absolutely merits Respect from all the World, as she does that Passion and Resignation she receives from your Lordship; and which is, on her part, with so much Ten<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e219">[Page]</span>derness return'd. Methinks your tranquil Lives are an Image of the new Made and Beautiful Pair in Paradise: And 'tis the Prayers and Wishes of all, who have the Honour to know you, that it may Eternally so continue, with Additions of all the Blessings this World can give you.</p><p>My Lord, the Obligations I have to some of the Great Men of your Nation, particularly to your Lordship, gives me an Ambition of making my Acknowledgments, by all the Opportunities I can; and such humble Fruits, as my Industry produces, I lay at your Lordships Feet. This is a <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e223">[Page]</span>true Story, of a Man Gallant enough to merit your Protection; and, had he always been so Fortunate, he had not made so Inglorious an end: The Royal Slave I had the Honour to know in my Travels to the other World; and though I had none above me in that Country, yet I wanted power to preserve this Great Man. If there be any thing that seems Romantick, I beseech your Lordship to consider, these Countries do, in all things, so far differ from ours, that they produce unconceivable Wonders; at least, they appear so to us, because New and Strange. What I have mention'd I have taken-care shou'd <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e225">[Page]</span>be Truth, let the Critical Reader judge as he pleases. 'Twill be no Commendation to the Book, to assure your Lordship I writ it in a few Hours, though it may serve to Excuse some of its Faults of Connexion; for I never rested my Pen a Moment for Thought: 'Tis purely the Merit of my Slave that must render it worthy of the Honour it begs; and the Author of that of Subscribing herself,</p><div class="closer">My Lord, Your Lordship's most oblig'd and obedient Servant, <div class="signed">A.

Then we trade for Feathers, which they order into all Shapes, make themselves little short Habits of 'em, and glorious Wreaths for their Heads, Necks, Arms and Legs, whose Tinctures are unconceivable. I had a Set of these presented to me, and I gave 'em to the King's Theatre, and it was the Dress of the <a class="link_ref" id="a008" href="#n008" title="Here is an image of Anne Bracegirdle performing in John Drydens play The Indian Queen wearing the feathered headress referred t...">Indian Queen</a> infinitely admir'd by Persons of Quality; and were unimitable.

The Beads they weave into Aprons about a quarter of an Ell long, and of the same breadth; working them very prettily in Flowers of several Colours of Beads; which Apron they wear just before 'em, as <span class="hi">Adam</span> and <span class="hi">Eve</span> did the Fig-leaves; the Men wearing a long Stripe of Linen, which they deal with us for. They thread these Beads also on long Cotton-threads, and make Girdles to tie their Aprons to, which come twenty times, or more, about the Waste; and then cross, like a Shoulder-belt, both ways, and round their Necks, Arms and Legs. This Adornment, with their long black Hair, and the Face painted in little Specks or Flowers here and there, makes 'em a wonderful Figure to<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e335">[Page 7]</span> behold. Some of the Beauties which indeed are finely shap'd, as almost all are, and who have pretty Features, are very charming and novel; for they have all that is called Beauty, except the Colour, which is a reddish Yellow; or after a new Oiling, which they often use to themselves, they are of the colour of a new Brick, but smooth, soft and sleek. They are extream modest and bashful, very shy, and nice of being touch'd. And though they are all thus naked, if one lives for ever among 'em, there is not to be seen an indecent Action, or Glance; and being continually us'd to see one another so unadorn'd, so like our first Parents before the Fall, it seems as if they had no Wishes; there being nothing to heighten Curiosity, but all you can see, you<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e337">[Page 8]</span> see at once, and every Moment see; and where there is no Novelty, there can be no Curiosity. Not but I have seen a handsom young <span class="hi">Indian,</span> dying for Love of a very beautiful young <span class="hi">Indian</span> Maid; but all his Courtship was, to fold his Arms, pursue her with his Eyes, and Sighs were all his Language: While she, as if no such Lover were present; or rather, as if she desired none such, carefully guarded her Eyes from beholding him; and never approach'd him, but she look'd down with all the blushing Modesty I have seen in the most severe and cautious of our World. And these People represented to me an absolute <span class="hi">Idea</span> of the first State of Innocence, before Man knew how to sin: And 'tis most evident and plain, that simple Nature is the most harmless, inoffen<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e349">[Page 9]</span>sive and vertuous Mistress. 'Tis she alone, if she were permitted, that better instructs the World, than all the Inventions of Man: Religion wou'd here but destroy that Tranquillity, they possess by Ignorance; and Laws wou'd but teach 'em to know Offence, of which now they have no Notion. They once made Mourning and Fasting for the Death of the <span class="hi">English</span> Governor, who had given his Hand to come on such a Day to 'em, and neither came, nor sent; believing, when once a Man's Word was past, nothing but Death cou'd or shou'd prevent his keeping it: And when they saw he was not dead, they ask'd him, what Name they had for a Man who promis'd a thing he did not do? The Governor told them, Such a man was a <span class="hi">Lyar,</span> which<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e357">[Page 10]</span> was a Word of Infamy to a Gentleman. Then one of 'em reply'd, <span class="hi">Governor, you are a Lyar, and guilty of that Infamy.</span> They have a Native Justice, which knows no Fraud; and they understand no Vice, or Cunning, but when they are taught by the <span class="hi">White Men.</span> They have Plurality of Wives, which, when they grow old, they serve those that succeed 'em, who are young; but with a Servitude easie and respected; and unless they take Slaves in War, they have no other Attendants.</p><p>Those on that <span class="hi">Continent</span> where I was, had no King; but the oldest War-Captain was obey'd with great Resignation.</p><p>A War-Captain is a Man who has lead them on to Battel with Conduct, and Success; of whom I shall have Occasion to speak<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e372">[Page 11]</span> more hereafter, and of some other of their Customs and Manners, as they fall in my way.</p><p>With these People, as I said, we live in perfect Tranquillity, and good Understanding, as it behooves us to do; they knowing all the places where to seek the best Food of the Country, and the Means of getting it; and for very small and unvaluable Trifles, supply us with what 'tis impossible for us to get; for they do not only in the Wood, and over the <span class="hi">Sevana's,</span> in Hunting, supply the parts of Hounds, by swiftly scouring through those almost impassable places; and by the meer Activity of their Feet, run down the nimblest Deer, and other eatable Beasts: But in the water, one wou'd think they were Gods of the Rivers, or Fellow-Citizens of the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e379">[Page 12]</span>Deep; so rare an Art they have in Swimming, Diving, and almost Living in Water; by which they command the less swift Inhabitants of the Floods. And then for Shooting; what they cannot take, or reach with their Hands, they do with Arrows; and have so admirable an Aim, that they will split almost an Hair; and at any distance that an Arrow can reach, they will shoot down Oranges, and other Fruit, and only touch the Stalk with the Dart's Points, that they may not hurt the Fruit. So that they being, on all Occasions, very useful to us, we find it absolutely necessary to caress 'em as Friends, and not to treat 'em as Slaves; nor dare we do other, their Numbers so far surpassing ours in that <span class="hi">Continent.</span></p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e385">[Page 13]</span>Those then whom we make use of to work in our Plantations of Sugar, are <span class="hi">Negro's, Black-</span>Slaves altogether; which are transported thither in this manner.</p><p>Those who want Slaves, make a Bargain with a Master, or Captain of a Ship, and contract to pay him so much a-piece, a matter of twenty Pound a Head for as many as he agrees for, and to pay for 'em when they shall be deliver'd on such a Plantation: So that when there arrives a Ship laden with Slaves, they who have so contracted, go a-board, and receive their Number by Lot; and perhaps in one Lot that may be for ten, there may happen to be three or four Men; the rest, Women and Children: Or be there more or less of either Sex, you are oblig'd to be contented with your Lot.</p><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e392">[Page 14]</div><p><a class="link_ref" id="a010" href="#n010" title="Coramantien was the name both of slavetrading castle depicted here and of the coastal area of what is now the nation of Ghana w...">Coramantien,</a> a Country of <span class="hi">Blacks</span> so called, was one of those places in which they found the most advantageous Trading for these Slaves; and thither most of our great Traders in that Merchandice traffick'd; for that Nation is very war-like and brave; and having a continual Campaign, being always in Hostility with one neighbouring Prince or other, they had the fortune to take a great many Captives; for all they took in Battel, were sold as Slaves; at least, those common Men who cou'd not ransom themselves. Of these Slaves so taken, the General only has all the profit; and of these Generals, our Captains and Masters of Ships buy all their Freights.</p><p>The King of <span class="hi">Coramantien</span> was himself a Man of a Hundred and<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e406">[Page 15]</span> odd Years old, and had no Son, though he had many beautiful <span class="hi">Black-</span>Wives; for most certainly, there are Beauties that can charm of that Colour. In his younger Years he had had many gallant Men to his Sons, thirteen of which died in Battel, conquering when they fell; and he had only left him for his Successor, one Grand-Child, Son to one of these dead Victors; who, as soon as he cou'd bear a Bow in his Hand, and a Quiver at his Back, was sent into the Field, to be trained up by one of the oldest Generals, to War; where, from his natural Inclination to Arms, and the Occasions given him, with the good Conduct of the old General, he became, at the Age of Seventeen, one of the most expert Captains, and bravest Soldiers, that ever saw <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e411">[Page 16]</span>the Field of <span class="hi">Mars:</span> So that he was ador'd as the Wonder of all that World, and the Darling of the Soldiers. Besides, he was adorn'd with a native Beauty so transcending all those of his gloomy Race, that he strook an Awe and Reverence, even in those that knew not his Quality; as he did in me, who beheld him with Surprize and Wonder, when afterwards he arriv'd in our World.</p><p>He had scarce arriv'd at his Seventeenth Year, when fighting by his Side, the General was kill'd with an Arrow in his Eye, which the Prince <span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> (for so was this gallant <span class="hi">Moor</span> call'd) very narrowly avoided; nor had he, if the General, who saw the Arrow shot, and perceiving it aim'd at the Prince, had not bow'd his Head between, on purpose to receive it in his own <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e424">[Page 17]</span>Body rather than it shou'd touch that of the Prince, and so saved him.</p><p>'Twas then, afflicted as <span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> was, that he was proclaim'd Genéral in the old Man's place; and then it was, at the finishing of that War, which had continu'd for two Years, that the Prince came to Court; where he had hardly been a Month together, from the time of his fifth Year, to that of Seventeen; and 'twas amazing to imagine where it was he learn'd so much Humanity; or, to give his Accomplishments a juster Name, where 'twas he got that real Greatness of Soul, those refin'd Notions of true Honour, that absolute Generosity, and that Softness that was capable of the highest Passions of Love and Gallantry, whose Objects were almost<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e431">[Page 18]</span> continually fighting Men, or those mangl'd, or dead; who heard no Sounds, but those of War and Groans: Some part of it we may attribute to the Care of a <span class="hi">French-</span>Man of Wit and Learning; who finding it turn to very good Account to be a sort of Royal Tutor to this young <span class="hi">Black,</span> &amp; perceiving him very ready, apt, and quick of Apprehension, took a great pleasure to teach him Morals, Language and Science; and was for it extreamly belov'd and valu'd by him. Another Reason was, He lov'd, when he came from War, to see all the <span class="hi">English</span> Gentlemen that traded thither; and did not only learn their Language, but that of the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> also, with whom he traded afterwards for Slaves.</p><p>I have often seen and convers'd with this great Man, and been a Witness to many of his mighty Actions; and do assure my Reader, the most Illustrious Courts cou'd not have produc'd a braver Man, both for Greatness of Courage and Mind, a Judgment more solid, a Wit more quick, and a Conversation more sweet and diverting. He knew almost as much as if he had read much: He had heard of, and admir'd the <span class="hi">Romans;</span> he had heard of the late <a class="link_ref" id="a011" href="#n011" title="The English Civil Wars of 1642 1649 between the supporters of the Stuart monarchy and the supporters of Parliament which led to...">Civil Wars</a> in <span class="hi">England,</span> and the deplorable Death of our great Monarch; and wou'd discourse of it with all the Sense, and Abhorrence of the Injustice imaginable. He had an extream good and graceful Mien, and all the Civility of a well-bred great Man. He had nothing of Barbarity in his Nature, but in all Points address'd himself, as if his Education had been in some <span class="hi">European</span> Court.</p><p>This great and just Character of <span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> gave me an extream Curiosity to see him, especially when I knew he spoke <a class="link_ref" id="a012" href="#n012" title="Behns emphasis on Oroonokos knowledge of French and English associates him with civilized Europeans eloquent Africans in Europe...">French</a> and English, and that I cou'd talk with him. But though I had heard so much of him, I was as greatly surpriz'd when I saw him, as if I had heard nothing of him; so beyond all Report I found him. He came into the Room, and address'd himself to me, and some other Women, with the best Grace in the World. He was pretty tall, but of a Shape the most exact that can be fansy'd: The most famous <a class="link_ref" id="a014" href="#n014" title="An artist who makes statues a sculptor of statues. (OED)">Statuary</a> cou'd not form the Figure of a Man more admirably turn'd from Head to Foot. His Face was not of that brown, rusty Black which most of that Nation are, but a perfect Ebony, or polish'd Jett. His Eyes were the most <a class="link_ref" id="a015" href="#n015" title="aweinspiring">awful</a> that cou'd be seen, and very piercing; the White of 'em being like Snow, as were his Teeth. His Nose was rising and <span class="hi">Roman,</span> instead of <span class="hi">African</span> and flat. His Mouth, the finest shap'd that cou'd be seen; far from those great turn'd Lips, which are so natural to the rest of the <span class="hi">Negroes.</span> The whole Proportion and Air of his Face was so noble, and exactly form'd, that, <a class="link_ref" id="a016" href="#n016" title="excepting">bating</a> his Colour, there cou'd be nothing in Nature more beautiful, agreeable and handsome. There was no one Grace wanting, that bears the Standard of true Beauty: His Hair came down to his Shoulders, by the Aids of Art; which was, by pulling it out with a Quill, and keeping it comb'd; of which he took particular Care. Nor did the Perfections of his Mind come short of those of his Person; for his Discourse was admirable upon almost any Subject; and who-ever had heard him speak, wou'd have been convinc'd of their Errors, that all fine Wit is confin'd to the <span class="hi">White</span> Men, especially to those of <span class="hi">Christendom;</span> and wou'd have confess'd that <span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> was as capable even of reigning well, and of governing as wisely, had as great a Soul, as <a class="link_ref" id="a017" href="#n017" title="prudent shrewd sagacious (OED)">politick</a> Maxims, and was as sensible of Power as any Prince civiliz'd in the most refin'd Schools of Humanity and Learning, or the most Illustrious Courts.</p><p>This Prince, such as I have describ'd him, whose Soul and Body were so admirably adorn'd, was (while yet he was in the Court of his Grandfather) as I said, as capable of Love, as 'twas possible for a brave and gallant Man to be;and in saying that, I have nam'd the highest Degree of Love; for sure, great Souls are most capable of that Passion.</p><p>I have already said, the old General was kill'd by the shot of an Arrow, by the Side of this Prince, in Battel; and that <span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> was made General. This old dead <span class="hi">Hero</span> had one only Daughter left of his Race; a Beauty that, to describe her truly, one need say only, she was Female to the noble Male; the beautiful <span class="hi">Black Venus,</span> to our young <span class="hi">Mars;</span> as charming in her Person as he, and of delicate Vertues. I have seen an hundred <span class="hi">White</span> Men sighing after her, and making a thousand Vows at her Feet, all vain, and unsuccessful: And she was, indeed, too great for any, but a Prince of her own Nation to adore.</p><p><span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> coming from the Wars, (which were now ended) after he had made his Court to his Grandfather, he thought in Honour he ought to make a Visit to <span class="hi">Imoinda,</span> the Daughter of his Foster-father, the dead General; and to make some Excuses to her, because his Preservation was the Occasion of her Father's Death; and to present her with those Slaves that had been taken in this last Battel, as the Trophies of her Father's Victories. When he came, attended by all the young Soldiers of any Merit, he was infinitely surpriz'd at the Beauty of this fair Queen of Night, whose Face and Person was so exceeding all he had ever beheld, that lovely Modesty with which she receiv'd him, that Softness in her Look, and Sighs, upon the melancholy Occasion of this Honour that was done by so great a Man as <span class="hi">Oroonoko,</span> and a Prince of whom she had heard such admirable things; the Awfulness wherewith she receiv'd him, and the Sweetness of her Words and Behaviour while he stay'd, gain'd a perfect Conquest over his fierce Heart, and made him feel, the Victor cou'd be subdu'd. So that having made his first Complements, and presented her an hundred and fifty Slaves in Fetters, he told her with his Eyes, that he was not insensible of her Charms; while <span class="hi">Imoinda,</span> who wish'd for nothing more than so glorious a Conquest, was pleas'd to believe, she understood that silent Language of new-born Love; and from that Moment, put on all her Additions to Beauty.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e538">[Page 26]</span> The Prince return'd to Court with quite another Humour than before; and though he did not speak much of the fair <span class="hi">Imoinda,</span> he had the pleasure to hear all his Followers speak of nothing but the Charms of that Maid; insomuch that, even in the Presence of the old King, they were extolling her, and heightning, if possible, the Beauties they had found in her: So that nothing else was talk'd of, no other Sound was heard in every Corner where there were Whisperers, but <span class="hi">Imoinda! Imoinda!</span></p><p>'Twill be imagin'd <span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> stay'd not long before he made his second Visit; nor, considering his Quality, not much longer before he told her, he ador'd her. I have often heard him say, that he admir'd by what strange Inspiration he came to talk things so soft, and<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e551">[Page 27]</span> so passionate, who never knew Love, nor was us'd to the Conversation of Women; but (to use his own Words) he said, Most happily, some new, and till then unknown Power instructed his Heart and Tongue in the Language of Love, and at the same time, in favour of him, inspir'd <span class="hi">Imoinda</span> with a Sense of his Passion. She was touch'd with what he said, and return'd it all in such Answers as went to his very Heart, with a Pleasure unknown before: Nor did he use those Obligations ill, that Love had done him; but turn'd all his happy Moments to the best advantage; and as he knew no Vice, his Flame aim'd at nothing but Honour, if such a distinction may be made in Love; and especially in that Country, where Men take to themselves as many<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e556">[Page 28]</span> as they can maintain; and where the only Crime and Sin with Woman is, to turn her off, to abandon her to Want, Shame and Misery: Such ill Morals are only practis'd in <span class="hi">Christian-</span>Countries, where they prefer the bare Name of Religion; and, without Vertue or Morality, think that's sufficient. But <span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> was none of those Professors; but as he had right Notions of Honour, so he made her such Propositions as were not only and barely such; but, contrary to the Custom of his Country, he made her Vows, she shou'd be the only woman he wou'd possess while he liv'd; that no Age or Wrinkles shou'd incline him to change, for her Soul wou'd be always fine, and always young; and he shou'd have an eternal <span class="hi">Idea</span> in his Mind of the Charms she now <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e568">[Page 29]</span>bore, and shou'd look into his Heart for that <span class="hi">Idea,</span> when he cou'd find it no longer in her Face.</p><p>After a thousand Assurances of his lasting Flame, and her eternal Empire over him, she condescended to receive him for her Husband; or rather, receiv'd him, as the greatest Honour the God's cou'd do her.</p><p>There is a certain Ceremony in these Cases to be observ'd, which I forgot to ask him how perform'd; but 'twas concluded on both sides, that, in Obedience to him, the Grand-father was to be first made acquainted with the Design: for they pay a most absolute Resignation to the Monarch, especially when he is a Parent also.</p><p>On the other side, the old King, who had many Wives, and many<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e580">[Page 30]</span> Concubines, wanted not Court-Flatterers to insinuate in his Heart a thousand tender Thoughts for this young Beauty; and who represented her to his Fancy, as the most charming he had ever possess'd in all the long Race of his numerous Years. At this Character his old Heart, like an extinguish'd Brand, most apt to take Fire, felt new Sparks of Love, and began to kindle; and now grown to his second Childhood, long'd with Impatience to behold this gay thing, with whom, alas! he cou'd but innocently play. But how he shou'd be confirm'd she was this <span class="hi">Wonder,</span> before he us'd his Power to call her to Court (where Maidens never came, unless for the King's private Use) he was next to consider; and while he was so doing, he had Intelligence <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e585">[Page 31]</span>brought him, that <span class="hi">Imoinda</span> was most certainly Mistress to the Prince <span class="hi">Oroonoko.</span> This gave him some <span class="hi">Shagrien;</span> however, it gave him also an Opportunity, one Day, when the Prince was a-hunting, to wait on a Man of Quality, as his Slave and Attendant, who shou'd go and make a Present to <span class="hi">Imoinda,</span> as from the Prince; he shou'd then, unknown, see this fair Maid, and have an Opportunity to hear what Message she wou'd return the Prince for his Present; and from thence gather the state of her Heart, and degree of her Inclination. This was put in Execution, and the old Monarch saw, and burnt: He found her all he had heard, and wou'd not delay his Happiness, but found he shou'd have some Obstacle to overcome her Heart; for she express'd <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e600">[Page 32]</span>her Sense of the Present the Prince had sent her, in terms so sweet, so soft and pretty, with an Air of Love and Joy that cou'd not be dissembl'd; insomuch that 'twas past doubt whether she lov'd <span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> entirely. This gave the old King some Affliction; but he salv'd it with this, that the Obedience the People pay their King, was not at all inferior to what they pay'd their Gods: And what Love wou'd not oblige <span class="hi">Imoinda</span> to do, Duty wou'd compel her to.</p><p>He was therefore no sooner got to his Apartment, but he sent the Royal Veil to <span class="hi">Imoinda;</span> that is, the Ceremony of Invitation; he sends the Lady, he has a Mind to honour with his Bed, a Veil, with which she is cover'd, and secur'd for the King's Use; and 'tis Death to disobey; besides, held a most impious Disobedience.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e615">[Page 33]</span> 'Tis not to be imagin'd the Surprize and Grief that seiz'd this lovely Maid at this News and Sight.

The King, without more Courtship, bad her throw off her Mantle, and come to his Arms. But <span class="hi">Imoinda,</span> all in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e622">[Page 34]</span> Tears, threw her self on the Marble, on the Brink of the Bath, and besought him to hear her.

Yet this <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e668">[Page 37]</span>serv'd not altogether to make him cease his different Passions, which sometimes rag'd within him, and sometimes softned into Showers. 'Twas not enough to appease him, to tell him, his Grand-father was old, and cou'd not that way injure him, while he retain'd that awful Duty which the young Men are us'd there to pay to their grave Relations. He cou'd not be convinc'd he had no Cause to sigh and mourn for the Loss of a Mistress, he cou'd not with all his Strength and Courage retrieve. And he wou'd often cry, <span class="hi">O my Friends! were she in wall'd Cities, or confin'd from me in Fortifications of the greatest Strength; did Inchantments or Monsters detain her from me, I wou'd venture through any Hazard to free her: Buthere, in the Arms of a feeble old Man, my Youth, my violent Love, my Trade</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e673">[Page 38]</span><span class="hi">in Arms, and all my vast Desire of Glory, avail me nothing:</span> Imoinda <span class="hi">is as irrecoverably lost to me, as if she were snatch'd by the cold Arms of Death: Oh! she is never to be retriev'd.

But as it was very hard to get a Sight of the Women, for no Men ever enter'd into the <span class="hi">Otan,</span> but when<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e707">[Page 40]</span> the King went to entertain himself with some one of his Wives, or Mistresses; and 'twas Death at any other time, for any other to go in; so he knew not how to contrive to get a Sight of her.</p><p>While <span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> felt all the Agonies of Love, and suffer'd under a Torment the most painful in the World, the old King was not exempted from his share of Affliction. He was troubl'd for having been forc'd by an irresistable Passion, to rob his <a class="link_ref" id="a022" href="#n022" title="Oroonoko is actually his grandson.">Son</a> of a Treasure, he knew, cou'd not but be extreamly dear to him, since she was the most beautiful that ever had been seen; and had besides, all the Sweetness and Innocence of Youth and Modesty, with a Charm of Wit surpassing all. He found that, however she was forc'd to expose her lovely Person to his wither'd Arms, she <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e717">[Page 41]</span>cou'd only sigh and weep there, and think of <span class="hi">Oroonoko;</span> and oftentimes cou'd not forbear speaking of him, though her Life were, by Custom, forfeited by owning her Passion. But she spoke not of a Lover only, but of a Prince dear to him, to whom she spoke; and of the Praises of a Man, who, till now, fill'd the old Man's Soul with Joy at every Recital of his Bravery, or even his Name. And 'twas this Dotage on our young <span class="hi">Hero,</span> that gave <span class="hi">Imoinda</span> a thousand Privileges to speak of him, without offending; and this Condescention in the old King, that made her take the Satisfaction of speaking of him so very often.</p><p>Besides, he many times enquir'd how the Prince bore himself; and those of whom he ask'd, being entirely Slaves to the Merits and Vertues <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e732">[Page 42]</span> of the Prince, still answer'd what they thought conduc'd best to his Service; which was, to make the old King fansy that the Prince had no more Interest in <span class="hi">Imoinda,</span> and had resign'd her willingly to the Pleasure of the King; that he diverted himself with his Mathematicians, his Fortifications, his Officers, and his Hunting.</p><p>This pleas'd the old Lover, who fail'd not to report these things again to <span class="hi">Imoinda,</span> that she might, by the Example of her young Lover, withdraw her Heart, and rest better contented in his Arms. But however she was forc'd to receive this unwelcome News, in all Appearance, with Unconcern, and Content, her Heart was bursting within, and she was only happy when she cou'd get alone, to vent her Griefs and Moans with Sighs and Tears.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e744">[Page 43]</span> What Reports of the Prince's Conduct were made to the King, he thought good to justifie as far as possibly he cou'd by his Actions; and when he appear'd in the Presence of the King, he shew'd a Face not at all betraying his Heart: So that in a little time the old Man, being entirely convinc'd that he was no longer a Lover of <span class="hi">Imoinda,</span> he carry'd him with him, in his Train, to the <span class="hi">Otan,</span> often to banquet with his Mistress. But as soon as he enter'd, one Day, into the Apartment of <span class="hi">Imoinda,</span> with the King, at the first Glance from her Eyes, notwithstanding all his determin d Resolution, he was ready to sink in the place where he stood; and had certainly done so, but for the Support of <span class="hi">Aboan,</span> a young Man, who was next to him; which, with his Change of Countenance,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e759">[Page 44]</span> had betray'd him, had the King chanc'd to look that way. And I have observ'd, 'tis a very great Error in those, who laugh when one says, <span class="hi">A</span> Negro <span class="hi">can change Colour;</span> for I have seen 'em as frequently blush, and look pale, and that as visibly as ever I saw in the most beautiful <span class="hi">White.</span> And 'tis certain that both these Changes were evident, this Day, in both these Lovers. And <span class="hi">Imoinda,</span> who saw with some Joy the Change in the Prince's Face, and found it in her own, strove to divert the King from beholding either, by a forc'd Caress, with which she met him; which was a new Wound in the Heart of the poor dying Prince. But as soon as the King was busy'd in looking on some fine thing of <span class="hi">Imoinda</span>'s making, she had time to tell the Prince with her angry,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e777">[Page 45]</span> but Love-darting Eyes, that she resented his Coldness, and bemoan'd her own miserable Captivity. Nor were his Eyes silent, but answer'd hers again, as much as Eyes cou'd do, instructed by the most tender, and most passionate Heart that ever lov'd: And they spoke so well, and so effectually, as <span class="hi">Imoinda</span> no longer doubted, but she was the only Delight, and the Darling of that Soul she found pleading in 'em its Right of Love, which none was more willing to resign than she. And 'twas this powerful Language alone that in an Instant convey'd all the Thoughts of their Souls to each other; that they both found, there wanted but Opportunity to make them both entirely happy. But when he saw another Door open'd by <span class="hi">Onahal,</span> a former old Wife of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e785">[Page 46]</span>the King's, who now had Charge of <span class="hi">Imoinda;</span> and saw the Prospect of a Bed of State made ready, with Sweets and Flowers for the Dalliance of the King; who immediately lead the trembling Victim from his Sight, into that prepar'd Repose. What Rage! what wild Frenzies seiz'd his Heart! which forcing to keep within Bounds, and to suffer without Noise, it became the more insupportable, and rent his Soul with ten thousand Pains. He was forc'd to retire, to vent his Groans; where he fell down on a Carpet, and lay struggling a long time, and only breathing now and then,—<span class="hi">O Imoinda!</span> When <span class="hi">Onahal</span> had finish'd her necessary Affair within, shutting the Door, she came forth to wait, till the King call'd; and hearing some one sighing in the other<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e797">[Page 47]</span> Room, she pass'd on, and found the Prince in that deplorable Condition, which she thought needed her Aid: She gave him Cordials, but all in vain; till finding the nature of his Disease, by his Sighs, and naming <span class="hi">Imoinda.</span> She told him, he had not so much Cause as he imagin'd, to afflict himself; for if he knew the King so well as she did, he wou'd not lose a Moment in Jealousie, and that she was confident that <span class="hi">Imoinda</span> bore, at this Minute, part in his Affliction. <span class="hi">Aboan</span> was of the same Opinion; and both together, perswaded him to re-assume his Courage; and all sitting down on the Carpet, the Prince said so many obliging things to <span class="hi">Onahal,</span> that he half perswaded her to be of his Party. And she promis'd him, she wou'd thus far comply with his just Desires, that she<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e812">[Page 48]</span> wou'd let <span class="hi">Imoinda</span> know how faithful he was, what he suffer'd, and what he said.</p><p>This Discourse lasted till the King call'd, which gave <span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> a certain Satisfaction; and with the Hope <span class="hi">Onahal</span> had made him conceive, he assum'd a Look as gay as 'twas possible a Man in his Circumstances cou'd do; and presently after, he was call'd in with the rest who waited without. The King commanded Musick to be brought, and several of his young Wives and Mistresses came all together by his Command, to dance before him; where <span class="hi">Imoinda</span> perform'd her Part with an Air and Grace so passing all the rest, as her Beauty was above 'em; and receiv'd the Present, ordain'd as a Prize. The Prince was every Moment more charm'd with the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e828">[Page 49]</span> new Beauties and Graces he beheld in this fair One: And while he gaz'd, and she danc'd, <span class="hi">Onahal</span> was retir'd to a Window with <span class="hi">Aboan.</span></p><p>This <span class="hi">Onahal,</span> as I said, was one of the <a class="link_ref" id="a023" href="#n023" title="Discarded former mistresses">Cast-Mistresses</a> of the old King; and 'twas these (now past their Beauty) that were made Guardians, or Governants to the new, and the young Ones; and whose Business it was, to teach them all those wanton Arts of Love, with which they prevail'd and charm'd heretofore in their Turn; and who now treated the triumphing happy Ones with all the Severity, as to Liberty and Freedom, that was possible, in revenge of those Honours they rob them of; envying them those Satisfactions, those Gallantries and Presents, that were once made to themselves, while Youth and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e845">[Page 50]</span>Beauty lasted, and which they now saw pass were regardless by, and pay'd only to the Bloomings. And certainly, nothing is more afflicting to a decay'd Beauty, than to behold in it self declining Charms, that were once ador'd; and to find those Caresses paid to new Beauties, to which once she laid a Claim; to hear 'em whisper as she passes by, <span class="hi">That once was a delicate Woman.</span> These abandon'd Ladies therefore endeavour to revenge all the Despights, and Decays of Time, on these flourishing happy Ones. And 'twas this Severity, that gave <span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> a thousand Fears he shou'd never prevail with <span class="hi">Onahal,</span> to see <span class="hi">Imoinda.</span> But, as I said, she was now retir'd to a Window with <span class="hi">Aboan.</span></p><p>This young Man was not only one of the best Quality, but a Man <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e865">[Page 51]</span>extreamly well made, and beautiful; and coming often to attend the King to the <span class="hi">Otan,</span> he had subdu'd the Heart of the antiquated <span class="hi">Onahal,</span> which had not forgot how pleasant it was to be in Love: And though she had some Decays in her Face, she had none in her Sence and Wit; she was there agreeable still, even to <span class="hi">Aboan</span>'s Youth; so that he took pleasure in entertaining her with Discourses of Love: He knew also, that to make his Court to these She-Favourites, was the way to be great; these being the Persons that do all Affairs and Business at Court. He had also observ'd that she had given him Glances more tender and inviting, than she had done to others of his Quality: And now, when he saw that her Favour cou'd so absolutely oblige the Prince, he<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e876">[Page 52]</span> fail'd not to sigh in her Ear, and to look with Eyes all soft upon her, and give her Hope that she had made some Impressions on his Heart. He found her pleas'd at this, and making a thousand Advances to him; but the Ceremony ending, and the King departing, broke up the Company for that Day, and his Conversation.</p><p><span class="hi">Aboan</span> fail'd not that Night to tell the Prince of his Success, and how advantageous the Service of <span class="hi">Onahal</span> might be to his Amour with <span class="hi">Imoinda.</span> The Prince was overjoy'd with this good News, and besought him, if it were possible, to caress her so, as to engage her entirely; which he cou'd not fail to do, if he comply'd with her Desires: <span class="hi">For then</span> (said the Prince) <span class="hi">her Life lying at your Mercy, she must grant you the Request you make in my</span><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e894">[Page 53]</span><span class="hi">Behalf.

To this Captain he sold abundance of his Slaves; and for the Favour and Esteem he had for him, made him many Presents, and oblig'd him to stay at Court as long as possibly he cou'd.

The same Treachery was us'd to all the rest; and all in one Instant, in several places of the Ship, were lash'd fast in Irons, and betray'd to Slavery.

But he besought 'em to bear their Chains with that Bravery that became those whom he had seen act so nobly in Arms; and that they cou'd not give him greater Proofs of their Love and Friendship, since 'twas all the Security the Captain (his Friend) cou'd have, against the Revenge, he said, they might possibly justly take, for the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e1513">[Page 99]</span> Injuries sustain'd by him.

There the Merchants and Gentlemen of the Country going on Board, to demand those Lots of Slaves they had already agreed on; and, amongst those, the Over-seers of those Plantations where I then chanc'd to be, the Captain, who had given the Word, order'd his Men to bring up those noble Slaves in Fetters, whom I have spoken of; and having put 'em, some in one, and some in other Lots, with Women and Children (which they call <a class="link_ref" id="a029" href="#n029" title="Darkskinned children usually of African descent.

He found the Prince was very much concern'd to know what became of his Friends, and how they took their Slavery; and <span class="hi">Trefry</span> promis'd to take care about the enquiring after their Condition, and that he shou'd have an Account of 'em.</p><p>Though, as <span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> afterwards said, he had little Reason to credit the Words of a <a class="link_ref" id="a032" href="#n032" title="An altered from of bakra buckra or buccra a word used in Surinam for master.">Backearary</a>, yet he knew not why; but he saw a kind<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e1619">[Page 106]</span> of Sincerity, and awful Truth in the Face of <span class="hi">Trefry;</span> he saw an Honesty in his Eyes, and he found him wise and witty enough to understand Honour; for it was one of his Maxims, <span class="hi">A Man of Wit cou'd not be a Knave or Villain.</span></p><p>In their passage up the <a class="link_ref" id="a033" href="#n033" title="The Suriname River">River</a>, they put in at several Houses for Refreshment; and ever when they landed, numbers of People wou'd flock to behold this Man; not but their Eyes were daily entertain'd with the sight of Slaves, but the Fame of <span class="hi">Oroonoko</span> was gone before him, and all People were in Admiration of his Beauty. Besides, he had a rich Habit on, in which he was taken, so different from the rest, and which the Captain cou'd not strip him of, because he was forc'd to surprize his Person in the Minute he sold him. When he found his<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e1635">[Page 107]</span> Habit made him liable, as he thought, to be gaz'd at the more, he begg'd <span class="hi">Trefry</span> to give him something more befitting a Slave; which he did, and took off his Robes.

But of all Discourses <span class="hi">Caesar</span> lik'd that the worst, and wou'd never be reconcil'd to our Notions of the Trinity, of which he ever made a Jest; it was a Riddle, he said, wou'd turn his Brain to conceive, and one cou'd not make him understand what Faith was. However, these Conversations fail'd not altogether so well to divert him, that he lik'd the Company of us Women much above the Men; for he cou'd not Drink; and he is but an ill Companion in that Country that cannot: So that obliging him to love us very well, we had all the Liberty of Speech with him, especially my self, whom he call'd <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e1972">[Page 143]</span> his <span class="hi">Great Mistress;</span> and indeed my Word wou'd go a great way with him. For these Reasons, I had Opportunity to take notice to him, that he was not well pleasd of late, as he us'd to be; was more retir'd and thoughtful; and told him, I took it Ill he shou'd Suspect we wou'd break our Words with him, and not permit both him and <span class="hi">Clemene</span> to return to his own Kingdom, which was not so long a way, but when he was once on his Voyage he wou'd quickly arrive there. He made me some Answers that shew'd a doubt in him, which made me ask him, what advantage it wou'd be to doubt? it would but give us a Fear of him, and possibly compel us to treat him so as I shou'd be<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e1980">[Page 144]</span> very loath to behold: that is, it might occasion his Confinement. Perhaps this was not so Luckily spoke of me, for I perceiv'd he resented that Word, which I strove to Soften again in vain: However, he assur'd me, that whatsoever Resolutions he shou'd take, he wou'd Act nothing upon the White-People; and as for my self, and those upon that <span class="hi">Plantation</span> where he was, he wou'd sooner forfeit his eternal Liberty, and Life it self, than lift his Hand against his greatest Enemy on that Place: He besought me to suffer no Fears upon his Account, for he cou'd do nothing that Honour shou'd not dictate; but he accus'd himself for having suffer'd Slavery so long; yet he charg'd that weakness on Love alone, who<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e1985">[Page 145]</span> was capable of making him neglect even Glory it self; and, for which, now he reproches himself every moment of the Day. Much more to this effect he spoke, with an Air impatient enough to make me know he wou'd not be long in Bondage; and though he suffer'd only the Name of a Slave, and had nothing of the Toil and Labour of one, yet that was sufficient to render him Uneasy; and he had been too long Idle, who us'd to be always in Action, and in Arms: He had a Spirit all Rough and Fierce, and that cou'd not be tam'd to lazy Rest; and though all endeavors were us'd to exercise himself in such Actions and Sports as this World afforded, as Running, Wrastling, Pitching the Bar, Hunting and Fishing,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e1988">[Page 146]</span> Chasing and Killing <span class="hi">Tigers</span> of a monstrous Size, which this Continent affords in abundance; and wonderful <span class="hi">Snakes,</span> such as <a class="link_ref" id="a044" href="#n044" title="The reference here is to Alexander the Great who by legend met Thallestris the Queen of the Amazons a race of female warriors w...">Alexander</a> is reported to have incounter'd at the River of <span class="hi">Amazons,</span> and which <span class="hi">Caesar</span> took great Delight to overcome; yet these were not Actions great enough for his large Soul, which was still panting after more renown'd Action.</p><p>Before I parted that Day with him, I got, with much ado, a Promise from him to rest yet a little longer with Patience, and wait the coming of the Lord Governor, who was every Day expected on our Shore; he assur'd me he wou'd, and this Promise he desired me to know was given perfectly in Complaisance to me,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e2007">[Page 147]</span>in whom he had an intire Confidence.</p><p>After this, I neither thought it convenient to trust him much out of our View, nor did the Country who fear'd him; but with one accord it was advis'd to treat him Fairly, and oblige him to remain within such a compass, and that he shou'd be permitted, as seldom as cou'd be, to go up to the Plantations of the Negroes; or, if he did, to be accompany'd by some that shou'd be rather in appearance Attendants than Spys. This Care was for some time taken, and <span class="hi">Caesar</span> look'd upon it as a Mark of extraordinary Respect, and was glad his discontent had oblig'd 'em to be more observant to him; he received new assurance from <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e2014">[Page 148]</span>the Overseer, which was confirmed to him by the Opinion of all the Gentlemen of the Country, who made their court to him: During this time that we had his Company more frequently than hitherto we had had, it may not be unpleasant to relate to you the Diversions we entertain'd him with, or rather he us.</p><p>My stay was to be short in that Country, because my Father dy'd at Sea, and never arriv'd to possess the Honour was design'd him, (which was Lieutenant-General of Six and thirty Islands, besides the Continent of <span class="hi">Surinam)</span> nor the advantages he hop'd to reap by them; so that though we were oblig'd to continue on our Voyage, we did not <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e2021">[Page 149]</span>intend to stay upon the Place: Though, in a Word, I must say thus much of it, That certainly had his late Majesty, of sacred Memory, but seen and known what a vast and charming World he had been Master off in that Continent, he would never have parted so Easily with it to the <span class="hi">Dutch.</span> 'Tis a Continent whose vast Extent was never yet known, and may contain more Noble Earth than all the Universe besides; for, they say, it reaches from East to West; one Way as far as <span class="hi">China,</span> and another to <span class="hi">Peru:</span> It affords all things both for Beauty and Use; 'tis there Eternal Spring, always the very Months of <span class="hi">April, May</span> and <span class="hi">June;</span> the Shades are perpetual, the Trees, bearing at once all degrees of Leaves and Fruit,<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e2039">[Page 150]</span> from blooming Buds to ripe Autumn; Groves of Oranges, Limons, Citrons, Figs, Nutmegs, and noble Aromaticks, continually bearing their Fragrancies.

When they came in view, they found her muzzling in the Belly of a new ravish'd Sheep, which she had torn open; and seeing herself approach'd, she took fast hold of her Prey, with her fore Paws, and set a very fierce raging Look on <span class="hi">Caesar,</span> without offering to approach him; for fear, at the<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e2152">[Page 160]</span> same time, of loosing what she had in Possession.

It is on this basis that Oroonoko himself owns slaves. The distinction he is making here is that, according to this doctrine, slaves gained through conquest are justified while slaves acquired through trickery or commerce are not.</div><div class="note" id="n067"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Renegades</div><div class="note" id="n068"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Tuscan’s name derives from the late Latin Tuscānus meaning “of or belonging to the Tuscī or Thuscī, a people of ancient Italy (called also Etruscī Etruscans)” (OED). The Etruscans inhabited ancient Etruria, so Tuscan’s name implies nobility and European origins.</div><div class="note" id="n069"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>According to the Roman historian Plutarch, the Carthaginian general Hannibal used vinegar and fire to burn his way through the Alps to attack the Roman army.</div><div class="note" id="n070"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Of high social standing; the upper class</div><div class="note" id="n071"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Poorly treated</div><div class="note" id="n072"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Subjected to public disgrace (OED)</div><div class="note" id="n074"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>William Byam is a real historical personage, noted both in Antione Biet’s Voyage de la France équixonale en l’isle de Cayenne (1654) and Henry Adis’s A Letter Sent from Syrrinam (1664). As deputy governor of Surinam, Byam ruled the colony in the absence of Lord Willoughby. According to Flannigan’s Antigua and the Antiguans. A Full Account of the Colony and its Inhabitants, after the Dutch takeover of Surinam, Byam led many of the British colonists to Antigua, where became governor and lived until c. 1670. Todd notes that both Biet and Adis, otherwise critical of the colony in Surinam, praise Byam: Adis refers to him as “that worthy person, whom your Lordship hath lately honoured with the Title and Power of your Lieutenant General of this Continent of Guinah”; while Biet describes him as brave, honorable, and civil (pp. 263, 279). Behn’s decision to portray him as cowardly and deceitful appears to have been her own. On the other hand, Byam did face accusations of unnecessary cruelty in his governance from an opposition group led by John Allin. Byam wrote a tract An Exact Relation of the Most Execrable Attempts of John Allin (1665) defending the need for harsh measures to govern the unruly colonists and accusing Allin of insurrection.</div><div class="note" id="n075"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>More commonly cat-o'-nine-tails, a whip with nine knotted lashes, often used for corporal punishment in the British military until 1881.

In contrast to Behn’s positive portrayal, Robert Sanford depicts Marten in Surinam Justice (1662) with many of the negative traits assigned to Byam and other colonists by Behn: he is eager to commit violent acts, cruel, ill-tempered, profane, and “so famous in nothing as his variety of councels: and it seems the whole bulk of Government must dance to the changes of his brain."Colonel Martin indeed appears as a character in Behn's play The Younger Brother, Or, The Amorous Jilt. Behn's self-promotion is premature, however, since the play was not produced until 1696, seven years after her death</div><div class="note" id="n083"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Surgeon</div><div class="note" id="n084"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>A room in a house designed for the use of a particular person</div><div class="note" id="n085"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Threats</div><div class="note" id="n086"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>imitate, deride, or amuse (OED)</div><div class="note" id="n087"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>The central prison in London</div><div class="note" id="n088"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Throughout this period, many criminals found guilty of crimes against property in Britain were sentenced by being "transported" or exiled for a period of years to the colonies.</div><div class="note" id="n089"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>With no one speaking to the contrary.</div><div class="note" id="n090"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Offices of government in Whitehall, London.

Bannister then became major-general of Jamaica. Bannister was killed in 1673 by Mr. Burford, a surveyor-general, who was then hanged.</div></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address> Aphra Behn Birth: 1640 December 14?
