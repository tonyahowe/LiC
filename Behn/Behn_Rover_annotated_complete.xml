            <l>Than a New <hi>Play</hi> whose Author is unknown.</l>
            <l>Nor can those Doctors with more Malice sue</l>
            <l>(And powerful Purses) the discenting Few,</l>
            <l>Than those with an Insulting Pride, do raile</l>
            <l>At all who are not of their own Caball:</l>
            <l>If a Young Poet hitt your Humour right,</l>
            <l>You judg him then out of Revenge and Spight.</l>
            <l>So amongst men there are Ridiculous Elves,</l>
            <l>Who Monkeys hate for being too like themselves.</l>
            <l>So that the reason of the grand debate,</l>
            <l>Why Witt so oft is damn'd, when good <hi>Plays</hi> take,</l>
            <l>Is, that you Censure as you love, or hate.</l>
            <l>Thus like a Learned Conclave Poets sit,</l>
            <l>Catholique Judges both of Sense and Wit,</l>
            <l>And Damn or Save, as they themselves think fit.</l>
            <l>Yet those who to others faults are so severe,</l>
            <l>Are not so perfect but themselves may Erre.</l>
            <l>Some write Coract indeed, but then the whole</l>
            <l>(Bating their own Dull stuff i'th' <hi>Play</hi>) is stole:</l>
            <l>As Bees do suck from Flowers their Honey dew,</l>
            <l>So they rob others striving to please you.</l>
            <l>Some write their Characters Gentile and fine,</l>
            <l>But then they do so Toyl for every line,</l>
            <pb/>
            <l>That what to you does Easie seem, and Plain,</l>
            <l>Is the hard Issue of their labouring Brain.</l>
            <l>And some th' Effects of all their pains we see,</l>
            <l>Is but to Mimick good Extemporie.</l>
            <l>Others by long Converse about the Town,</l>
            <l>Have Witt enough to write a Lew'd <hi>Lampoon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But their chief skill lyes in a Bawdy Song.</l>
            <l>In short, the only Witt that's now in Fashon,</l>
            <l>Is but the gleenings of good Conversation.</l>
            <l>As for the Author of this Coming <hi>Play,</hi>

At this time, Naples was ruled by Spain, which explains why so many characters in the play have been traveling back and forth between Naples and places like Madrid and Pamplona.

which made the Book-sellers fear some trouble from the Proprietor of that Admirable
Play, which indeed has Wit enough to stock a Poet, and is not to be peec't or mended
by any but the Excellent Author himself; That I have stoln some hints from it,
may be a proof, that I valu'd it more than to pretend to alter it; had I had the
Dexterity of some Poets, who are not more Expert in stealing than in the Art of
Concealing, and who even that way out-do the <hi>Spartan</hi>-Boyes. I might have appropriated
all to my self, but I, vainly proud of my Iudgment, hang out the Sign
of <hi>Angellica,</hi> (the only stoln Object) to give Notice where a great part of the Wit
dwelt; tho if the Play of the <hi>Novella</hi> were as well worth remembring as <hi>Thomaso,</hi>
they might (bating the Name) have as well said, I took it from thence: I will
only say the Plot and Bus'ness (not to boast on't) is my own: as for the Words
and Characters, I leave the Reader to judge and compare 'em with <hi>Thomaso,</hi> to
whom I recommend the great Entertainment of reading it, tho had this succeeded ill,
I shou'd have had no need of imploring that Justice from the Criticks, who are naturally
so kind to any that pretend to usurp their Dominion, they wou'd doubtless
have given me the whole Honour on't. Therefore I will only say in <hi>English</hi> what
